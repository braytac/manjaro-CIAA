Simple, no-frills theme with warm colors for GTK 2/3 based on the “Mist-Redmond” theme:

https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1013685/

The GTK2 theme is nearly identical to Mist-Redmond, except for the different theme color (green instead of blue).

The GTK3 theme was written from scratch to match the GTK2 theme and work with the newest GTK3 version (3.20 as of August 2016).

For debugging purposes, the default style for unkown elements in the GTK3 theme is strikingly colorful (yellow-magenta with thick red border). If you encounter elements with this style, please send a bug report to the author with your GTK+ version, the application and the element that shows the bug and preferably a screenshot. (To find out your current GTK+ version, run “gtk3-widget-factory” and check the “About” dialog from the menu in the upper left corner.)

For Arch Linux, an AUR package will be available:
